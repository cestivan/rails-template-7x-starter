# Authentication Generator Testing

The authentication generator now includes a comprehensive test suite that covers all authentication functionality.

## Generated Tests

When you run `rails generate authentication`, the following test files will be created:

### Factory Files
- `spec/factories/users.rb` - User factory with traits for verified/unverified users
- `spec/factories/sessions.rb` - Session factory with expired session trait

### Model Tests
- `spec/models/user_spec.rb` - Tests for User model validations, associations, and authentication
- `spec/models/session_spec.rb` - Tests for Session model validations, associations, and scopes

### Request Tests
- `spec/requests/sessions_spec.rb` - Login/logout functionality tests
- `spec/requests/registrations_spec.rb` - User registration tests
- `spec/requests/authenticated_access_spec.rb` - **Home page access tests after login (200 status verification)**

### Test Helpers
- `spec/support/authentication_helpers.rb` - Helper methods for signing in users in tests

## Key Test Features

### Authentication Flow Tests
- User registration with valid/invalid parameters
- User login with correct/incorrect credentials
- Session management and persistence
- Logout functionality

### Home Page Access Verification
The `authenticated_access_spec.rb` file includes critical tests that verify:
- **Root path returns 200 status after successful login**
- Protected pages require authentication
- Session persistence across multiple requests
- Complete authentication flow integration

### Example Important Test
```ruby
it "returns 200 status code for root path" do
  sign_in_user(user)
  get root_path
  expect(response).to have_http_status(:success)
end
```

## Running the Tests

After generating the authentication system:

1. Run migrations: `rails db:migrate`
2. Install new gems: `bundle install` (includes faker gem)
3. Run the authentication tests: `bundle exec rspec spec/requests/authenticated_access_spec.rb`
4. Run all authentication tests: `bundle exec rspec spec/factories spec/models spec/requests/sessions_spec.rb spec/requests/registrations_spec.rb spec/requests/authenticated_access_spec.rb`

## Test Dependencies

The generated tests use:
- RSpec Rails
- FactoryBot Rails
- Faker (automatically added to Gemfile)
- Capybara (for integration tests)

No additional gems need to be installed - the generator handles all dependencies.

## Customization

You can customize the tests by:
- Modifying factory attributes in `spec/factories/`
- Adding additional test scenarios to request specs
- Extending the authentication helpers with project-specific methods
- Adding feature tests for UI interactions
